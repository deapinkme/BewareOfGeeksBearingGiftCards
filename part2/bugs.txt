Explaining bugs.

Crash 1:
In line 25 num_bytes was changed 116 to -1, which crashes the reader in line 189. This
tries to allocate an invalid amount of memory. Security issues are commond in c because
of memory allocation issues. Here this seems to have happened as the value for num_bytes
was later used for malloc (memory allocation).

Crash 2:
Lines 35, 51, 55 and 57 have alterations, however did not succesfully crash the program.

I attempted to find a second crash. It seems as though the only way to create a crash would
be to alter the ints entered as in the previous example they may be used for memory allocation
or like in following example 


Hang:
In line 29 changing number_of_gift_card_records from 1 to 5. This creates an infinite loop
as it tries to access gift cards which have no records. It keeps trying to read infromation
that is not given.
