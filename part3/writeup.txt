Writeup part 3

Coverage 1:
Coverage.info shows that lines 79 to 100 are not all running. This is meant to print out
certain details such as record_type based on a condition.
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 1
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 2
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 3
Will alter which section of code runs in the range of those 21 lines. Since it is an if loop\
when one condition is sacified the others are not considered and therefore are not run.

Coverage 2:
225-254

Coverage.info shows that lines 225 to 254 are not all running. This is meant to allocate
memory differently based on a condition.
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 1
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 2
gcrd_ptr->type_of_record == 3
One again there is an if statement based on a condition that will alter which lines are being
run. The same condition is being altered however inputing 1, 2 or 3 for this will give three
different outcomes on which section/lines of code run.
